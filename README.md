# Convergence Omnibus Container
[![Build](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-omnibus-container/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/convergencelabs/convergence-omnibus-container/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The Convergence Omnibus Container is an all-in-one version of [Convergence](https://convergence.io) which is useful for developers to use when developing Convergence based applications. It is also useful for simple, or small installations that do not require high availability.

It contains the Convergence Server, the Convergence Admin Console, the Convergence Client, and an OrientDB Database.

For documentation, code samples, and information on Convergence Enterprise Edition (suitable for production use cases), please visit: [https://convergence.io](https://convergence.io)

## Basic Usage
To run, simply execute the following docker run command:

```shell script
docker run -p "8000:80" convergencelabs/convergence-omnibus
```

### URLS

- The Convergence Admin Console will be available at: `http://localhost:8000/`.
- The REST API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000/rest/`.
- The Realtime API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000/realtime/`. 
- The JavaScript API Documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.  
- The various client builds will available at `http://localhost:8000/client/`.

### Default Credentials
A default Server Admin user will be created when the container first starts up.  The default credentials are `admin` / `password`. These credentials can be changed via environment variables as shown below.

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables can be used to configure the Convergence server. All environment variables are option, and reasonable defaults are supplied.
 - **`CONVERGENCE_ADMIN_USERNAME`**: Configures the username of the default server admin user that will be created upon startup.
 - **`CONVERGENCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: Configures the password of the default server admin user that will be created upon startup.
 - **`CONVERGENCE_ADMIN_EMAIL`**: Configures the email of the default server admin user that will be created upon startup.
 - **`CONVERGENCE_ADMIN_DISPLAY_NAME`**: Configures the display name of the default server admin user that will be created upon startup.
 - **`CONVERGENCE_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`**: Configures the default namespace for the server.  Defaults to "convergence".
 - **`CONVERGENCE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ID`**: Configures the id of the default domain that will be created.  Defaults to `default`.
 - **`CONVERGENCE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN_DISPLAY_NAME`**: Configures the display name of the default domain that will be created.  Defaults to `Default`.
 - **`EXTERNAL_REMOTING_PORT`**: Configures the port that Akka remoting is reachable on outside of the container. Useful if behind a proxy.  Defaults to `25520`.
 - **`EXTERNAL_REMOTING_HOSTNAME`**: Configures the hostname that Akka remoting is reachable on outside of the container. Useful if behind a proxy.  Defaults to `localhost`.
 - **`HTTP_PORT`**: Configures the HTTP port the built-in NGINX server will listen on. Defaults to `80`.
 
## Common Docker options 
To run in detached mode (in a separate process): `-d`
Give the container a name: `--name convergence`  This allows commands like `docker logs -f convergence` 

## Persistent Data 
Convergence stores data in an OrientDB instance that runs inside the container. A Docker volume is defined at `/orientdb/databases` to persist the data. You can create a named or host mapped volume there if you wish to persist the data outside of the container. For examle:

```shell
docker run \
  -p "8000:80" \
  -v ${PWD}/databases:/orientdb/databases \
  convergencelabs/convergence-omnibus
```
